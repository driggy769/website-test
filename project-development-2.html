            Project Overview: React Data Dashboard (Personal Development
            Project)
          </h2>

          <p>
            This project was a self-initiated React application created in my
            own time, designed to build on the foundations established in my
            earlier React work. Unlike previous projects, the focus here shifted
            away from layout and component structure and towards working with
            datasets and displaying structured information in a meaningful way.
          </p>

          <p>
            The application takes the form of a dashboard-style interface,
            demonstrating how data can be surfaced, organised, and presented
            within a React environment. It was not built for commercial use, but
            as a focused learning exercise.
          </p>

          <h2>Learning Goals & Motivation</h2>

          <p>
            Following my initial hands-on experience with React, I wanted to
            deepen my understanding of how applications interact with data. The
            goal of this project was to learn how to work with datasets and
            database-style information, and how to render that data dynamically
            within a user interface.
          </p>

          <p>
            This meant thinking beyond static content and focusing on how data
            flows through an application, how it is stored, and how changes in
            state affect what the user sees.
          </p>

          <h2>Development Process</h2>

          <p>
            The project was structured around consuming and displaying
            structured datasets within React components. I focused on breaking
            data into logical units and ensuring it could be passed efficiently
            through the component tree.
          </p>

          <p>
            State management played a key role, allowing the interface to
            respond dynamically as data changed. This reinforced best practices
            around component responsibility, reusability, and separation of
            concerns.
          </p>

          <h2>Technical Learning & Outcomes</h2>

          <p>
            Through this project, I gained a clearer understanding of how React
            can be used to work with datasets and database-driven content.
            Handling data within state, mapping over datasets, and conditionally
            rendering content became central parts of the build process.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project helped bridge the gap between learning React
            fundamentals and applying them in more data-driven scenarios,
            providing valuable experience in building applications that are
            driven by information rather than static layouts.
