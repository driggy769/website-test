          <h2>Project Overview: Scanshot Marketing Email Campaigns</h2>

          <p>
            ScanShot is a recurring marketing email campaign produced for SCAN,
            designed to promote key commercial activity and keep subscribers
            informed of offers, events, and partner-led initiatives. The email
            was sent approximately three times per week to a large subscriber
            base and also archived on the main SCAN website, making it a highly
            visible and business-critical piece of marketing collateral.
          </p>

          <p>
            The content of ScanShot varied frequently and was designed to be
            flexible enough to support a wide range of use cases. These included
            promotional sales campaigns, announcements for industry events such
            as trade shows or in-house activations, and client-funded promotions
            where technology partners (for example, NVIDIA) would request
            visibility for specific product launches, such as the release of the
            RTX 40-series graphics cards.
          </p>

          <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>

          <p>
            I worked closely with the marketing team to design, build, and
            deliver each ScanShot email from concept through to deployment. My
            role covered both visual design and front-end email development,
            ensuring consistency, accuracy, and reliability across all sends.
          </p>

          <h2>Briefing & Concept Development</h2>

          <p>
            Each ScanShot began with a detailed brief from the marketing team.
            This outlined the overall concept of the email, the products or
            promotions that needed to be featured, and any mandatory content
            such as specific wording, brand guidelines, or partner-supplied
            imagery.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using this brief, I translated the requirements into a clear visual
            direction, ensuring the design aligned with SCAN’s brand identity
            while remaining flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of
            content types. Particular care was taken to balance promotional
            impact with clarity and readability, given the fast-paced nature of
            the campaign and its frequent distribution.
          </p>

          <h2>Design & Approval Process</h2>

          <p>
            I created initial design mockups in Adobe Photoshop, laying out the
            full email structure, hierarchy, and visual treatments. These
            mockups were shared with the marketing team for feedback and
            approval, allowing for iterations where necessary to ensure the
            final design met both internal expectations and external partner
            requirements.
          </p>

          <p>
            This stage was critical for maintaining consistency across the
            campaign while still allowing each ScanShot to feel timely,
            relevant, and tailored to its specific message.
          </p>

          <h2>Development & Testing</h2>

          <p>
            Once the design was approved, I coded the email using custom-built
            templates that I had developed and maintained. These templates were
            designed with flexibility and reusability in mind, allowing for
            quick turnaround times while ensuring compatibility across major
            email clients.
          </p>

          <p>
            After development, I produced and sent test emails to the marketing
            team for review. This allowed us to check layout accuracy, content
            correctness, and overall presentation before final approval. Any
            necessary refinements were made at this stage to ensure a polished
            final output.
          </p>

          <h2>Deployment & Archiving</h2>

          <p>
            Following approval, the ScanShot email was deployed to the full
            subscriber base. Each edition was also archived on the main SCAN
            website, extending its lifespan beyond the initial send and
            providing an accessible record of past campaigns.
          </p>

          <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>

          <p>
            ScanShot became a dependable and scalable marketing channel, capable
            of supporting high-frequency sends without compromising quality. The
            structured workflow — from briefing to design, development, testing,
            and deployment — ensured efficiency while maintaining a consistently
            high standard of execution.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project strengthened my ability to work at pace within a
            marketing environment, collaborate effectively with cross-functional
            teams, and manage the full lifecycle of a digital marketing asset.
            It also reinforced the importance of adaptability, as each ScanShot
            required tailoring to different audiences, partners, and commercial
            objectives while still fitting within a cohesive brand framework.
