          <h2>Project Overview: 3XS Custom Builds</h2>

          <p>
            Work on 3XS Custom Builds differed from other projects in that it
            supported a distinct branch of the business with its own identity
            and objectives. While operating under the wider SCAN umbrella, 3XS
            functioned as its own department with separate brand guidelines,
            offering greater creative freedom and scope to explore new concepts.
          </p>

          <p>
            This additional flexibility allowed for more experimentation in both
            visual design and user experience, while still ensuring consistency
            with the established 3XS brand.
          </p>

          <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>

          <p>
            I was involved in the full lifecycle of 3XS Custom Build pages, from
            initial concept and design through to development and deployment.
            This included interpreting briefs, designing page layouts, building
            interactive front-end features, and managing the transition from
            staging to live.
          </p>

          <h2>Briefing & Concept Development</h2>

          <p>
            As with other projects, each 3XS Custom Build began with a brief
            outlining the goals of the page, required content, and any
            constraints or brand considerations. However, compared to other
            areas of the business, these briefs allowed for greater creative
            input and encouraged exploration of new ideas.
          </p>

          <p>
            This made the concept phase particularly important, as it was an
            opportunity to propose enhancements to layout, functionality, and
            overall presentation that could improve engagement and conversion.
          </p>

          <h2>Design & Creative Exploration</h2>

          <p>
            Initial designs were created in Adobe Photoshop, following 3XS brand
            guidelines while allowing room for creative interpretation. At this
            stage, I had more freedom to influence not only the visual direction
            but also the functional elements of the page.
          </p>

          <p>
            This included exploring features such as call transitions,
            animations, and interactive elements, helping to create a more
            dynamic and engaging experience compared to standard brand or
            landing pages.
          </p>

          <h2>Development & Staging</h2>

          <p>
            Once the mockups were reviewed and signed off, the designs were
            translated into fully functional pages and built on the dedicated
            3XS staging site. This allowed for thorough testing and refinement
            before public release.
          </p>

          <p>
            The staging phase ensured that both design intent and interactive
            elements were accurately implemented and performed as expected.
          </p>

          <h2>Deployment & Outcome</h2>

          <p>
            After successful testing on staging, the pages were deployed to the
            live 3XS website. The result was a set of high-quality,
            brand-aligned pages that showcased custom build offerings while
            benefiting from enhanced creativity and interactivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project highlighted my ability to work within distinct brand
            ecosystems, contribute creatively beyond static design, and deliver
            engaging digital experiences from concept through to launch.
