            Project Overview: React Restaurant Website (Personal Development
            Project)
          </h2>

          <p>
            This project was a self-initiated development exercise focused on
            building a restaurant website using React. It was created entirely
            in my own time and was not intended for commercial use, serving
            instead as a practical way to deepen my understanding of modern
            front-end development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than designing the site from scratch in Photoshop, I used a
            free PSD template as a visual reference. This allowed me to focus my
            efforts on translating an existing design into a working React
            application, mirroring real-world scenarios where developers often
            work from supplied designs.
          </p>

          <h2>Learning Goals & Motivation</h2>

          <p>
            The primary goal of this project was to learn React in a hands-on,
            immersive way. Instead of consuming information in small, isolated
            examples, I wanted to challenge myself by building a complete
            project from start to finish.
          </p>

          <p>
            This approach encouraged problem-solving in context and helped
            reinforce concepts through practical application, rather than
            theoretical learning alone.
          </p>

          <h2>Development Process</h2>

          <p>
            I broke the design down into reusable components and focused on
            structuring the application in a way that felt scalable and
            maintainable. Working directly from the PSD helped guide layout
            decisions while leaving room to make technical choices appropriate
            for React.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout the build, I relied heavily on React’s core features,
            particularly hooks and state management, to control dynamic content
            and component behaviour.
          </p>

          <h2>Technical Learning & Outcomes</h2>

          <p>
            By building the application end to end, I developed a strong
            foundational understanding of React hooks and state. Managing
            component state, passing data between components, and handling
            re-renders became far more intuitive through real usage rather than
            isolated examples.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project marked an important step in my transition from static
            front-end work to more dynamic, component-driven development, and
            provided a solid base for more advanced React projects that
            followed.
