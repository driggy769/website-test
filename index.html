        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I’ve been creative for as long as I can remember. As soon as I could
          hold a pencil, I was drawing — filling sketchbooks with cartoons and
          dreaming of becoming an animator. That early love for visuals slowly
          evolved into a fascination with design, and by the time I was a
          teenager, my goal was clear: I wanted to be a graphic designer working
          on something I loved, whether that was a video game magazine like EDGE
          or a guitar magazine like Total Guitar.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 16, I landed my first design internship. It was there that a senior
          designer gave me a piece of advice that would quietly shape my entire
          career: “You should have a website portfolio, not just a physical
          one.” I couldn’t afford to pay someone to build it, so I did what felt
          natural — I taught myself how to make one.
        </p>
        <p>
          That decision changed everything. The website not only showcased my
          design work, but it also opened the door to my first junior web
          designer role. From there, my career naturally shifted toward
          development, and I began working across a range of industries
          including publishing, ecommerce, property marketing, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to work with some incredible
          brands, including Santander, AVIVA, NVIDIA, AMD, Microsoft, Chivas
          Regal, and Harrods. Each project has pushed me to grow — not just as a
          developer, but as a creative problem-solver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I’m a web developer who continues to learn, experiment, and
          refine my craft. While my technical skills have grown with every role,
          I’ve never let go of what started it all — a deep passion for design
          and creating things that look great, feel intuitive, and work
          beautifully.
