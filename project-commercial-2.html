          <h2>Project Overview: Dynamic Brand Pages & Landing Pages</h2>

          <p>
            A core part of my day-to-day role involved designing and building
            dynamic brand pages and landing pages for SCAN. These pages played a
            key role in supporting marketing initiatives, partner campaigns, and
            event promotions, acting as high-visibility destinations for both
            paid and organic traffic.
          </p>

          <p>
            The pages were often client-funded, meaning they needed to adhere
            closely to partner requirements while still maintaining SCAN’s brand
            standards. Campaigns ranged from the promotion of new hardware
            releases such as graphics cards and CPUs, to game launches and
            co-branded initiatives. In addition to commercial campaigns, landing
            pages were also created to support industry events that SCAN was
            either attending or hosting.
          </p>

          <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>

          <p>
            I was responsible for the end-to-end delivery of these pages,
            covering design, front-end build, and deployment to staging for
            review. This involved working with multiple stakeholders across the
            business and balancing creative requirements with technical and
            brand constraints.
          </p>

          <h2>Briefing & Stakeholder Collaboration</h2>

          <p>
            Briefs were provided by a range of teams depending on the nature of
            the project. Most commonly this was the marketing team, but requests
            also came from the 3XS team or, on occasion, directly from senior
            management when pages were required for high-profile events or
            time-sensitive campaigns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each brief outlined the purpose of the page, required content, brand
            or partner guidelines, and any specific goals such as promoting a
            product launch, highlighting an event, or driving engagement around
            a release.
          </p>

          <h2>Design & Mockups</h2>

          <p>
            Using the provided brief, I designed page layouts and visual
            concepts in Adobe Photoshop, creating clear and structured mockups
            that demonstrated hierarchy, layout, and overall visual direction.
            These mockups were shared with the requesting stakeholder for review
            and feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            This stage allowed for collaborative iteration, ensuring that the
            final design aligned with both internal expectations and any
            external partner requirements before moving into development.
          </p>

          <h2>Development & Deployment</h2>

          <p>
            Once designs were signed off, I translated the approved mockups into
            fully functional web pages. These were coded and deployed to the
            staging environment, where they could be tested and reviewed prior
            to going live.
          </p>

          <p>
            This process ensured accuracy, responsiveness, and consistency with
            existing site standards, while also allowing time for final checks
            and refinements before release.
          </p>

          <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>

          <p>
            These dynamic brand and landing pages became a reliable foundation
            for a wide range of marketing and commercial activity. By following
            a structured workflow — from briefing and design through to
            development and staging — I was able to deliver pages efficiently
            while maintaining a high level of quality and flexibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project strengthened my ability to work with diverse
            stakeholders, manage competing priorities, and deliver polished
            digital experiences that supported both brand and business
            objectives.
